[1] In a valiant but ultimately futile effort to bring proportionality to this action, I heard what I had hoped would be an attenuated refusals motion in which the parties might focus on what was truly needed to get the case to trial. It is apparent that the parties have much more on their respective plates than just this one piece of litigation. So their positions are driven by far wider considerations. Unless or until the court determines that the parties have consumed more than their fair share of scarce public resources, their battles appear to be destined to continue as unrelenting as the 500 year war between Eminiar VII and Vendikar.\footnote{“A Taste of Armageddon,” Star Trek, Season 1, Episode 23, NBC, February 23, 1967.}
